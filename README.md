# Shareable SDC demonstration

This is just an idea on how SDCs could be shared.

## Instructions
* Install [Composer Installers Extender](https://github.com/oomphinc/composer-installers-extender)
* Add your SDC repository under the `repositories` section
* Add the `shareable_sdc` project
* Enable the module `shareable_sdc` module

## Shareable SDC structure
* Ensure that you have a `composer.json` file on your SDC repository
* Set the project type as `drupal-component`

## Integration
This project uses [SDC Styleguide](https://www.drupal.org/project/sdc_styleguide) sto display the contrib components. This also allows to add demos
